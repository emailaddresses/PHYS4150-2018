# Introduction
1. key points
   * transistor
   * vacuum tube
   * integrated circuit
   * Moore's law
2. Computational Physics
3. Programming language
4. *TODO*

# Example: generate the first K prime number
1. a is divisible by b
2. prime number definition: a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers
3. algorithm: *TODO, add link to code*
   * New number (numerator) is not divisible by any prime number (denominator) smaller than itself
4. optimization
   * (numerator) skip if the New number is even
   * (denomiator) skip if the prime number is larger than half of the new number

# Example: calculate PI
1. Liu Hui's method
   * [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui%27s_%CF%80_algorithm)
   * MATLAB implementation see *TODO, add link to code*
2. Buffon's Needle problem (Monte Carlo Simulation)
   * [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle)
   * MATLAB implementation see *TODO, add link to code*
3. Series expansion
   * [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80)
   * MATLAB implementation see *TODO, add link to code*
