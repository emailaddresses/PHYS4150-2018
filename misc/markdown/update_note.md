## 20180913

* upload tutorial materials TS20190913
* upload lecture_note and lecture PPT
* fix Octave/MATLAB compatibility problem. Since function cannot be defined in Octave script, the origin ```code_template.m``` cannot run on Octave. now I have split ```unittest.m``` from ```code_template.m```. After that, code could run on both Octave/MATLAB (personally I really not recommand use Octave).

## 20180919

* merge ```lecture_PPT``` to ```lecture_note```
* rearrange ```lecture_note```; move some lecture notes (old-version) into ```old_version``` folder; add some new lecture note (e.g. Gaussian quadrature)
* move ```course information``` and ```contribution and license``` into subfolders, you could still view these content via the links below
* update ```FAQ```
* update ```TS20180920```
* add ```tentative syllabus```
