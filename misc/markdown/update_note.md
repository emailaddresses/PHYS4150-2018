* fix Octave/MATLAB compatibility problem. Since function cannot be defined in Octave script, the origin ```code_template.m``` cannot run on Octave. now I have split ```unittest.m``` from ```code_template.m```. After that, code could run on both Octave/MATLAB (personally I really not recommand use Octave).
