# submit and collect homework

Notice: *This instruction will use 0-square-root-of-complex-number (for demo only) fake homework for demonstration*

## Before the due date

1. go to course website to check the assignments / homeworks status
2. select the homework
3. read the homework instruction clearly
4. download ```code_template.m``` and ```unittest.m```
5. complete the basic info at the beggining of ```code_template.m```
   * ```name``` and ```uid```: used for gradding
   * ```put on course website```: if select yes, your homework will be put on course website. Personally, I strongly encourage you to do that, since others could learn coding skills and detailed algorithms from your homeworks, also you could receive programming suggestions from the others.
   * ```right reserved info```: if select yes above, this right reserved info will be shown along with your coding
   * **NOTICE, name and uid will not show on course website**
6. complete the algorithm in the ```code_template.m``` as homework required
   * there are some comments like ```% ---- start coding from here ----``` and ```%---end coding---``` to help you code, of course you could also code outside of that block.
   * run ```unittest.m``` to help you debug. Usually you will see ```unittest passed``` if you implement you code correctly.
7. send your homework via email
   * remember to rename ```code_template.m``` to some meaningful name.
   * usually there will be several homeworks share the same due time, so it would be better to send me just one email instead of several.

## After the due date

1. you could still submit the assignments / homeworks that have passed the due time. you could choose wheter to put on the course website, but will not be graded.
2. I will upload the reference answer sooner after the due time.
3. I will upload those coding which select yes to the course website.
4. I will print out all submitted homeworks, give marks, and then submit to physics department. Sooner after that, you could collect your homework from the shelf outside the physics department office.
