## About LICENSE

This code repo will borrow a lot of code from other source most of which will use a different LICENSE from current code repo. I am not sure whether the current repo LICENSE is compatible with that in the original source. If any incompitiblity, PLAESE give me advice on how to deal with that, many thanks.
