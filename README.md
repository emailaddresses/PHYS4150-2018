**claims: anything in this code repo not consistent with lecture content, plaese follow lecture content as standard**


# PHYS4150-2018
This is the website for course PHYS4150 Computational Physics, including course materials and some code snippet. 
I hope it will be helpful for course learning.

# Folder organization
1. ```lecture_note```: the official course lecture notes distributed by Prof. Wang. Most in ```.pdf``` format
2. ```lecture_PPT```: the official course PPT, usally updated after every course. Most in ```.ppt``` format
3. ```tutorial_material```: the tutorials session present content
   * ```.mlx```: MATLAB live scripts file, could only open in MATLAB, which combines both formatted explanatory text and code
   * ```.pdf```: every ```.mlx``` file will be converted to ```.pdf``` file for easy-view purpose
   * ```.txt```: tutorial session draft
4. ```homework```: *still under construction*
5. ```MD_lecture_note```: rewrite lecture note according to personal understanding. All in ```.MD``` format
6. ```code_draft```: demonstrate algorithms in code snippet
   * ```.mlx```: as above
   * ```.pdf```: as above
7. ```project```: *still under construction*
9. ```misc/*```: *still under construction*
   * ```misc/markdown```: write kinds of instructions markdown files
   * ```misc/axmath```: math formula in latex

# FAQ
*still under construction*
1. what is MATLAB live scripts ```.mlx```
 > see [official documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html;jsessionid=9a500aa277e7aa38ca708835117a). It's a good tool for demostration, but personally I do not recommand to use it
 for other use as currently ```.mlx``` is a little bit slower than that in ```.m``` or in command window.

# About LICENSE
This code repo will borrow a lot of code from other source most of which will use a different LICENSE from current code repo. I am not sure whether the current repo LICENSE is compatible with that in the original source. If any incompitiblity, PLAESE give me advice on how to deal with that, many thanks.
