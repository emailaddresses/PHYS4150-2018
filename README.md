## website organization

1. [lecture_note](https://github.com/husisy/PHYS4150-2018/tree/master/lecture_note): the course lecture notes distributed by Prof. Wang
2. [tutorial_material](https://github.com/husisy/PHYS4150-2018/tree/master/tutorial_material): the materials used in every tutorial session
   * ```.mlx```: MATLAB live scripts file, could only open in MATLAB, which combines both formatted explanatory text and code
   * ```.pdf```: every ```.mlx``` file will be converted to ```.pdf``` file for easy-view purpose
   * ```.pptx```: the Presentation files used in tutorial session
3. [homework](https://github.com/husisy/PHYS4150-2018/tree/master/homework): all homework-related information
   * all homeworks are listed in this folder (including the due date)
   * the homework instruction (what you should do to finish this homework)
   * homework solution and students' homework demostration (if they chose to put on the course website)
   * detail see [README.md](https://github.com/husisy/PHYS4150-2018/tree/master/homework) in that folder
4. [MD_lecture_note](https://github.com/husisy/PHYS4150-2018/tree/master/MD_lecture_note): *still under construction*; rewrite lecture note according to personal understanding. All in ```.md``` format

## FAQ

1. what is MATLAB live scripts ```.mlx```
   > see [official documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html;jsessionid=9a500aa277e7aa38ca708835117a). It's a good tool for demostration, but personally I do not recommand to use it for other use as currently ```.mlx``` is a little bit slower than that in ```.m``` or in command window.
2. can I use Python in this course
   > you could use Python to finish the homework, but we will not supply ```code_template.py``` for Python.
   > the basic info should be included in your submission. ```name```, ```uid```, ```whether to put on course website```, ```right reserved info```
   > for the final course project, you ```must``` use Octave/MATLAB. The project using Python will not be graded.
3. should I implement or improve the codes as the course website indicates or rewrite these code from myself?
   > it would be better if you implement or improve the codes as the course website indicates. Still, if you find those code don't help too much , you could rewrite them from empty.
   > remember to add basic information, e.g. name, uid, etc.
4. why got ```error, code_template is not found in the current folder or on the MATLAB path``` when I run ```unittest.m```?
   > DO NOT change the filename ```code_template.m``` since ```unittest.m``` trys to call function ```code_template()```

## course website TO-DO-LIST

1. *(personal prejudice towards Octave) WARNING: I will remove Octave compatibility one week after the course finish. If you want to keep this part, you should fork this repo before that*
2. FAQ, some of your homework forget to specify whether to put on course website or not
3. check whether links are valid, especially homewok
4. homework folder structure
5. add unittest.m instruction
6. optional homework6 and homework7
7. mathjax support
8. add ```demo_zone``` section
9. upload hw6
