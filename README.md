**claims: anything in this code repo not consistent with lecture content, plaese follow lecture content as standard**


# PHYS4150-2018
This is the website for course PHYS4150 Computational Physics, including course materials and some code snippet. 
I hope it will be helpful for course learning.

# About LICENSE
This code repo will borrow a lot of code from other source most of which will use a different LICENSE from current code repo. I am not sure whether the current repo LICENSE is compatible with that in the original source. If any incompitiblity, PLAESE give me advice on how to deal with that, many thanks.
