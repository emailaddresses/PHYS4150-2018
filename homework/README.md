*still under construction*

*notice: here list all the problems that waiting for your contribution whether they are GRADED or NOT*

If you find some problems worth sharing (should be related to the course), you could tell me (by email / PR / issue), 
and I will add it to this list if suitable; It will be better to come up with new problems along with solutions.


# problem set
1. from lecture note
2. from contribution
3. from whatever
4. *TODO*


# 1 - programming get started
1. go through Octave or MATLAB get-started tutorials

   * [Using Octave](https://wiki.octave.org/Using_Octave)
   * [Octave Programming Tutorials / Getting started](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Octave_Programming_Tutorial/Getting_started)
2. Type the code yourself and see the results. If not understand the code, use doc(bulabula) to get help
3. several check lists
   * ```clc```
   * ```create matrix use []```
   * ```;```
